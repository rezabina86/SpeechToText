### Data Layer
- **AVFoundation**: Handles audio recording and playback functionality
- **Speech**: Integrates Apple's Speech Recognition framework for transcription

### Domain Layer (Business Logic)
- **AudioPlayerManager**: Manages audio playback operations
- **AudioRecorderManager**: Handles audio recording functionality  
- **SpeechRecognitionManager**: Coordinates speech-to-text conversion
- **SpeechRecognitionUseCase**: Encapsulates speech recognition business logic

### Presentation Layer
- **AppViewModel**: Manages app state and coordinates between layers
- **View**: SwiftUI-based user interface

4. Build and run on device (speech recognition requires a physical device)

## üöÄ Usage

1. **Record**: Tap the "Record" button to start recording
2. **Transcribe**: Watch as your speech appears as text in real-time
3. **Stop**: Tap "Stop Recording" when finished
4. **Playback**: Use "Play" to hear your recording
5. **Reset**: Clear the current session with "Reset"
